<h2 id= "header2"> Food </h2>
<p>   Food’s carbon footprint, or foodprint, is the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food you eat.<br> People often don't factor in their greenhouse gas emissions into their decisions in diet. The majority of Americans are not very keen with the idea of cutting out meat, but swapping a beef burger with chicken can make a difference.  <br> Another factor that adds to your total carbon footprint is how far your food traveled before it got to you. Transporting food is accounts for a tenth of food based greenhouse gas emissions.

 <h2 id="header3">Clothing</h2>
<p>This trend is gaining traction as both designers and consumers become increasingly aware of -- and startled by -- the outsize toll linear clothing production takes on the environment. "Fashion's carbon impact is much larger than the industry's GDP. It's taking up more than its fair share of impact on the planet," said Elizabeth L. Cline, author of the forthcoming book "The Conscious Closet: The Revolutionary Guide to Looking Good While Doing Good."</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of "fast fashion" -- the business of quickly turning around new collections, often at lower prices to encourage consumption -- in particular is proving to be toxic for the environment. Linear systems use large quantities of nonrenewable resources, and more than half of these styles get tossed within a year, according to McKinsey's 2016 report "Style that's sustainable: A new fast fashion formula."<br> Many popular clothing companies are offenders of fast fashion, pumping out cloths at a rate of twenty new pieces of clothing per person</p>

<h2 id="header4"> Transportation & household</h2>

  <p>Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm, resulting in changes to the climate we are already starting to see today.
<br>The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990–2017 (the national inventory that the U.S. prepares annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), transportation accounted for the largest portion (29%) of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2017. Cars, trucks, commercial aircraft, and railroads, among other sources, all contribute to transportation end-use sector emissions.</p>
